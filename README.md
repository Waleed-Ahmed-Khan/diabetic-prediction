# Diabetic Prediction System

Welcome to the Diabetic Prediction System by Waleed Ahmed! This system is designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more. Below, you'll find a detailed guide on how to use this system effectively.

## Uploads <a name="uploads"></a>

In the **Uploads** section, you can upload your own CSV file containing the relevant data for diabetic prediction. If you don't have a suitable dataset, you can download one from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set). Once you upload your file, it will be processed and displayed for further analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <a name="eda"></a>

The **EDA** section allows you to explore the uploaded data in detail. It provides various insights such as summary statistics, data distribution, correlations, and more. You can visualize the data using interactive charts and graphs to gain a better understanding of the dataset.

## Machine Learning (ML) <a name="ml"></a>

In the **ML** section, the uploaded data is used to train and evaluate different machine learning models for diabetic prediction. Models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, and Neural Networks are trained and compared based on their performance metrics. Confusion matrices and classification reports are provided to assess the effectiveness of each model.

## Prediction <a name="prediction"></a>

The **Prediction** section allows you to make predictions for new data based on the trained machine learning models. You can input the relevant features for an individual, and the system will predict whether they are likely to have diabetes or not.

**Note:** It's recommended to upload your data and perform EDA before proceeding to the ML and Prediction sections for better insights and understanding.

Enjoy using the Diabetic Prediction System! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to Waleed Ahmed.
